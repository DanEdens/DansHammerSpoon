# Development Notes - Right Layout Toggle Feature

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented a toggle feature for the hammer+7 hotkey that switches between rightSmall and rightHalf layouts. This feature demonstrates a pattern for implementing toggles between related layout functions.

## Key Components

1. **State Management**: Added a local table `rightLayoutState` to track the current toggle state
2. **Toggle Function**: Created a `toggleRightLayout()` function that:
   - Flips the boolean state
   - Applies the appropriate layout based on state
   - Shows an alert with the active layout name

3. **Hotkey Integration**: Modified the hammer+7 hotkey binding to use the toggle function
4. **Documentation**: Updated the README.md and created a task summary document

## Benefits

- Reduces the need for separate hotkeys for similar actions
- Improves user experience with visual feedback
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing hyper+7 binding

## Lessons Learned

1. **Implementation Approach**: Creating a simple toggle state approach is very effective for binary toggles. For more complex multi-state toggles, a more sophisticated approach would be needed.

2. **Visual Feedback**: Adding the hs.alert.show() call provides critical feedback to users about which state is currently active. Without this, it would be difficult for users to know which layout is currently selected.

3. **Modular Design**: By implementing the toggle logic in a separate function rather than directly in the hotkey binding, we make the code more maintainable and testable.

## Future Enhancement Ideas

1. **State Persistence**: Store toggle states in persistent storage to maintain them across Hammerspoon reloads.

2. **Extensible Toggle Framework**: Create a generic toggle system that could be easily applied to other layout pairs.

3. **Multi-State Toggles**: Extend the concept to support cycling through 3+ layouts instead of just toggling between two.

4. **User Configuration**: Allow users to customize which layouts are included in toggles through a configuration file.

## Git Workflow

- Created feature branch `feature/right-layout-toggle`
- Made targeted changes to specific files
- Added thorough documentation
- Committed with descriptive messages
