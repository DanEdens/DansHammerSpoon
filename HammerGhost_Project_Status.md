# HammerGhost Project Status Report

## Recent Accomplishments

### 1. Critical Bug Fix
Successfully identified and fixed a path construction bug in the HammerGhost.spoon that was preventing the module from loading properly. The issue was related to duplicate path references in the action_manager.lua file. The fix was simple but critical:

```lua
-- Before:
local actionSystem = dofile(hs.spoons.resourcePath("scripts/action_system.lua"))

-- After:
local actionSystem = dofile(hs.spoons.resourcePath("action_system.lua"))
```

This fix ensures the spoon loads correctly and all necessary modules are properly initialized.

### 2. Documentation and Knowledge Capture
Created comprehensive documentation of the WebView implementation in Hammerspoon, with specific focus on:
- Bidirectional communication patterns between Lua and JavaScript
- UI architecture using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Common implementation patterns and best practices
- Lessons learned from analyzing the codebase

### 3. Project Organization
- Created a consolidated todo list tracking all pending tasks
- Prioritized tasks for efficient development
- Added specific tasks to the MCP Todo Server for tracking
- Added valuable lessons learned to share knowledge

## Current Project Status

### Core Components
- **Base Structure**: ~30% complete
- **WebView UI**: Basic implementation working, needs refinement
- **Tree Visualization**: 60% complete, actively being worked on
- **Action System**: Basic structure in place, requires implementation of actions
- **State Management**: Minimal implementation, needs significant work

### Known Issues
1. Several core interaction functions are stubbed but not implemented (selection, editing, deletion)
2. XML parser is loaded but not fully utilized for configuration persistence
3. Navigation and selection tracking is incomplete
4. Properties panel exists but lacks full functionality

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Next 1-2 Weeks)
1. Complete core item interaction functions (selection, editing, deletion)
2. Finish Advanced Tree Visualization implementation
3. Implement proper message passing architecture

### Short-term Goals (Next 1 Month)
1. Add action system building blocks
2. Enhance trigger system with more event types
3. Implement basic script editor
4. Improve state management and persistence

### Long-term Vision
1. Comprehensive automation platform within Hammerspoon
2. User-friendly visual interface for Hammerspoon capabilities
3. Robust action library covering common automation needs
4. Community-friendly sharing and extension system

## Resource Requirements
- Development time: Estimated 3-4 months for a complete v1.0
- Testing: Requires comprehensive testing across different macOS versions
- Documentation: Needs ongoing updates as features are implemented

## Recommendations
1. Tackle the core item interactions first to establish a functional foundation
2. Focus on improving the bidirectional communication architecture early
3. Implement a small but complete set of actions to demonstrate capabilities
4. Create comprehensive documentation alongside development

By addressing these priorities, the HammerGhost project can progress from its current state to a fully functional automation platform within Hammerspoon.
