# Project Manager Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive project/job management system for Hammerspoon that allows users to create, edit, delete, and interact with project definitions. The system provides a modern UI for project management and integration with the operating system for opening projects in various applications.

## Implementation Details

### Core Functionality
- **Project Management**: Create a system to track and manage development projects
- **Active Project**: Allow setting a currently active project for use with tools and scripts
- **Persistent Storage**: Save project data between Hammerspoon sessions using JSON
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Provide quick access to project management functionality

### UI Components
- **Project Manager Dialog**: Web-based UI for creating and editing projects
- **Project Chooser**: Selection interface for existing projects
- **Actions Menu**: Context-specific actions for each project
- **Info Display**: Active project information display

### New Files Created
1. **ProjectManager.lua**: 
   - Core module with project data structures and functions
   - Web UI implementation for project editing
   - File system integration via hs.dialog and hs.execute
   - Persistent storage using hs.json

2. **ProjectManager_README.md**:
   - Comprehensive documentation of the module
   - Usage instructions and examples
   - Feature list and future enhancements

### Updates to Existing Files
1. **hotkeys.lua**:
   - Added ProjectManager module import
   - Created keyboard shortcuts for project management:
     - `hammer+j`: Open Project Manager UI
     - `hyper+j`: Show active project info

2. **init.lua**:
   - Added ProjectManager module loading on startup

3. **README.md**:
   - Updated Core Modules section with ProjectManager info
   - Added Project Management section to keyboard shortcuts

4. **CHANGES.md**:
   - Documented the new feature
   - Listed implementation details and lessons learned

5. **.gitignore**:
   - Added projects.json to prevent tracking user project data

## Technical Approach
- Used **webview-based UIs** for rich formatting and interactivity
- Implemented **URL-based communication** between webviews and Hammerspoon
- Utilized **chooser UI** for efficient selection interfaces
- Created **persistent storage** with hs.json
- Integrated with **system dialogs** for file paths

## Challenges and Solutions
- **UI Design**: Created modern, clean interfaces using HTML/CSS within webviews
- **Data Persistence**: Implemented robust loading/saving with error handling
- **System Integration**: Connected project paths with system applications

## Testing
Tested all major functionality:
- Project creation, editing, and deletion
- Active project setting and display
- Project actions (opening in Finder, Terminal, editors)
- Persistence of project data between sessions

## Future Enhancements
1. Project templates for quick project creation
2. Project-specific window layouts
3. Version control system integration
4. Custom actions per project
5. Recently opened projects tracking

## Conclusion
The ProjectManager module provides a powerful and flexible system for managing development workspaces. It integrates well with the existing Hammerspoon configuration and expands its capabilities for professional developers who work across multiple projects.
