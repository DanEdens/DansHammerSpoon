# WindowToggler Task Summary

## Task Completed
Added a window management tool that tracks window positions by title and allows toggling between the current position and a "nearlyFull" layout.

## Implementation
1. Created a new module `WindowToggler.lua` with the following features:
   - Position storage by window title rather than ID
   - Position toggle functionality between current position and nearlyFull layout
   - Functions to list and clear saved positions
   - Intelligent detection of window position to determine toggle behavior

2. Added hotkeys to `hotkeys.lua`:
   - `hammer+w`: Toggle window position
   - `hyper+w`: List saved window positions
   - `hammer+q`: Clear saved positions

3. Created documentation:
   - `WindowToggler_README.md`: Detailed module documentation
   - Updated `README.md`: Added information about the new feature
   - Created `CHANGES.md`: Documented the implementation details and lessons learned

4. Workflow:
   - Created a feature branch (`feature/window-toggle-by-title`)
   - Made incremental commits
   - Tested the implementation
   - Merged back to main branch

## Benefits
- More persistent window position tracking (survives application restarts)
- Simpler toggle experience compared to manually saving/restoring positions
- Improved workflow by allowing quick toggling between working positions and presentation mode

## Possible Future Enhancements
1. Save positions to disk for persistence across Hammerspoon restarts
2. Support multiple saved positions per window title
3. Add support for toggling between positions and other layouts beyond nearlyFull
4. Deeper integration with the existing WindowManager module
