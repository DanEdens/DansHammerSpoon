- [ ] Improve localStorage handling for window positions
- [ ] Add error handling for all user-facing functions
- [ ] Review and optimize performance of window management functions
- [ ] Add proper logging throughout the codebase

## Spoon Management
- [ ] Review currently loaded Spoons in loadConfig.lua and remove commented out entries
- [ ] Implement conditional loading of Spoons based on user configuration
- [ ] Add proper error handling for missing or failed Spoon loads
- [x] Create a better startup notification system for loaded Spoons
- [x] Implement automatic initialization of Spoons with start() methods
