# TouchBar Alternative for Mac Pro: CustomControlBar Spoon

## Background

**Important Clarification**: Mac Pros (desktop machines) do not have TouchBars. TouchBars were only available on certain MacBook Pro models from 2016-2021 before Apple discontinued them in favor of physical function keys.

## Problem Statement

User requested TouchBar functionality for Mac Pro, but needs alternative solution that provides similar benefits:
- Quick access to contextual controls
- Customizable interface elements
- Application-specific functionality
- Touch-like interaction paradigms

## Proposed Solution: CustomControlBar Spoon

### Core Features

1. **Floating Control Panel**
   - Resizable, moveable window
   - Always-on-top or show/hide with hotkey
   - Customizable position (top, bottom, side)
   - Transparency and theme support

2. **Context-Aware Controls**
   - Different button sets per application
   - Auto-switch based on focused app
   - Global controls always available
   - User-defined application profiles

3. **Control Types**
   - Buttons (with icons and text)
   - Sliders (volume, brightness, etc.)
   - Text displays (time, system stats)
   - Toggle switches
   - Custom widgets

4. **Configuration**
   - JSON/Lua configuration files
   - Runtime customization
   - Profile import/export
   - Template system

### Technical Implementation

```lua
-- Example usage:
hs.loadSpoon("CustomControlBar")

-- Configure for Safari
spoon.CustomControlBar:addAppProfile("com.apple.Safari", {
    buttons = {
        {icon = "bookmark", action = "cmd+d", tooltip = "Bookmark Page"},
        {icon = "back", action = "cmd+[", tooltip = "Back"},
        {icon = "forward", action = "cmd+]", tooltip = "Forward"},
        {icon = "reload", action = "cmd+r", tooltip = "Reload"}
    }
})

-- Configure for Final Cut Pro
spoon.CustomControlBar:addAppProfile("com.apple.FinalCutPro", {
    buttons = {
        {icon = "play", action = "space", tooltip = "Play/Pause"},
        {icon = "split", action = "cmd+b", tooltip = "Blade Tool"},
        {icon = "zoom", action = "cmd+plus", tooltip = "Zoom In"}
    },
    sliders = {
        {type = "timeline", min = 0, max = 100, callback = timelineCallback}
    }
})

spoon.CustomControlBar:start()
```

### Benefits Over Virtual TouchBar

1. **Better suited for desktop use** - No laptop dependencies
2. **More customizable** - Not limited by TouchBar constraints
3. **Larger display area** - Can be sized appropriately
4. **Mouse and keyboard friendly** - Better for desktop workflows
5. **Always available** - No special hardware requirements

### Development Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Basic floating panel with configurable buttons
2. **Phase 2**: Application context switching
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced controls (sliders, widgets)
4. **Phase 4**: Theme system and advanced customization

## Alternative Options Considered

1. **Virtual TouchBar Simulation**: Using `hs._asm.undocumented.touchbar`
   - Pros: Mimics real TouchBar behavior
   - Cons: Limited to TouchBar constraints, may be unstable

2. **Stream Deck Integration**: External hardware solution
   - Pros: Physical buttons, dedicated device
   - Cons: Requires additional hardware purchase

3. **Menu Bar Enhancement**: Extend existing menu bar
   - Pros: Native integration
   - Cons: Limited space and customization

## Recommendation

Proceed with **CustomControlBar Spoon** development as it provides the most practical and flexible solution for Mac Pro users who want TouchBar-like functionality without the hardware limitations.
