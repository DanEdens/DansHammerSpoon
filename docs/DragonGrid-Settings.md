# DragonGrid Settings Menu

DragonGrid now includes a settings menu that allows you to customize its behavior without modifying configuration files. This menu provides a convenient way to adjust grid settings on the fly.

## Accessing the Settings Menu

To open the settings menu:

1. Press `Hyper+X` (Cmd+Shift+Ctrl+Alt+X)
2. A grid icon (⊞) will appear in your menu bar with a dropdown menu

## Available Settings

The settings menu offers the following customization options:

### Grid Size

Configure the density of the grid cells:

- **2×2**: Simple 4-cell grid for basic positioning
- **3×3**: Standard 9-cell grid (default)
- **4×4**: Dense 16-cell grid for more precision
- **5×5**: Very dense 25-cell grid for maximum precision

A larger grid size allows for more precise initial positioning but may be harder to target the desired cell.

### Precision Layers

Set how many layers of grids to use:

- **1 Layer**: Single grid level only
- **2 Layers**: Two levels of grid precision (default)
- **3 Layers**: Three levels for maximum precision

More layers allow for finer positioning but require additional steps to reach the final position.

### Mode

Choose how the grid is displayed:

- **Screen Mode**: Grid covers the entire screen (default)
- **Window Mode**: Grid is confined to the active window

Window mode is useful when you need to target UI elements within a specific application window.

### Background Opacity

Adjust the opacity of the grid background:

- **10%**: Very transparent
- **20%**: Slightly transparent
- **30%**: Medium transparency (default)
- **50%**: Less transparent

Lower opacity values make it easier to see the content behind the grid.

## Additional Options

The menu also provides quick actions:

- **Launch Grid**: Immediately activates the DragonGrid with current settings
- **Close Menu**: Removes the menu from the menu bar

## Usage Tips

1. Adjust grid size based on your positioning needs - larger grids are better for precise operations
2. Use fewer precision layers for quick positioning, more layers for surgical precision
3. Window mode is great for application-specific tasks
4. Try different opacity settings based on your screen and background content
