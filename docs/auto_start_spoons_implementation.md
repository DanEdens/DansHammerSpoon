# Automatic Spoon Initialization Implementation

## Summary
This implementation adds automatic initialization capability to the Hammerspoon configuration. Instead of having to manually start each Spoon after loading, the system now automatically detects if a Spoon has a `start()` method and calls it if available.

## Changes Made

1. Modified `loadConfig.lua`:
   - Removed the specific code that checked only for ClipboardTool and started it
   - Added a generic loop that checks all loaded Spoons for a start() method
   - Added visual feedback through alerts when Spoons are successfully started

2. Updated documentation:
   - Added entries to CHANGES.md
   - Updated README.md to include the new feature in the overview and recent improvements sections

## Benefits

1. **Simplicity**: No need to manually start each Spoon in the configuration
2. **Consistency**: All Spoons are handled the same way
3. **Extensibility**: Adding new Spoons that have start methods is now automatic
4. **Visibility**: Alerts provide feedback about which Spoons are successfully started

## Implementation Details

The core of the implementation is a simple loop that:
1. Iterates through all loaded Spoons
2. Checks if each Spoon has a start() method
3. Calls the start() method if available
4. Shows an alert with the name of the Spoon that was started

```lua
-- Start each spoon that has a start function
for _, spoon_name in pairs(hspoon_list) do
    if spoon[spoon_name] and type(spoon[spoon_name].start) == "function" then
        spoon[spoon_name]:start()
        hs.alert.show(spoon_name .. " started")
    end
end
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:
1. Adding configuration options to enable/disable automatic starting
2. Logging failed starts or Spoons without start methods
3. Adding error handling for Spoons that fail to start properly
4. Implementing a dependency system between Spoons
