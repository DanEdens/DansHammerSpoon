# Fix duplicate logging in HyperLogger

## Issue
The startup log contained duplicate messages - one with links and one with timestamps. This was caused by the HyperLogger module calling both the custom styled logger AND the standard Hammerspoon logger. Each logging method was:

1. Sending logs to the standard hs.logger (with [file:line] format)
2. Also printing its own styled version directly to the console

This resulted in every log message appearing twice:
- Once from hs.logger with timestamp but no clickable links
- Once from the HyperLogger's custom styled version

## Solution
Modified HyperLogger.lua to:
1. Remove calls to the base logger's logging methods (i, d, w, e)
2. Only use the styled text version to avoid duplication
3. Kept the base logger for compatibility but stopped sending log messages through it
4. Fixed the format of the styled logs to show the file/line info after the message text instead of before it

## Testing
After reloading Hammerspoon, logs will only appear once in the console with proper styling and file links.

## Future Enhancements
Consider:
- Adding an option to toggle standard logger output if needed for specific use cases
- Improving color scheme for better visibility
- Adding user-configurable formatting options
