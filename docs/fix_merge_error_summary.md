# Merge Error Fix Summary

## Issue Description
A merge conflict resulted in incorrectly placed code from the HammerGhost spoon being appended to the main `init.lua` file. This caused a runtime error:

```
2025-05-28 17:19:44: *** ERROR: /Users/d.edens/.hammerspoon/init.lua:899: attempt to index a nil value (global 'config')
stack traceback:
	/Users/d.edens/.hammerspoon/init.lua:899: in main chunk
```

## Root Cause Analysis
During a merge operation, code from the HammerGhost spoon (specifically from `Spoons/HammerGhost.spoon/init.lua`) was incorrectly appended to the main `init.lua` configuration file. This included:

1. **Functions that don't belong in main config:**
   - `itemToHTML()` - HTML generation function for HammerGhost UI
   - `findItem()` - Tree traversal function for macro management

2. **Variables and references that don't exist in main scope:**
   - `self` - Object reference that only exists within the HammerGhost spoon
   - `config` - Module that's only loaded within the HammerGhost spoon context
   - `self.configPath`, `self.macroTree`, `self.currentSelection` - Instance variables

3. **Inappropriate method calls:**
   - `config.loadMacros(self.configPath)` - Trying to call a method on undefined `config`

## Changes Made

### Files Modified
- **`init.lua`**: Removed 67 lines of incorrectly merged HammerGhost spoon code

### Code Removed
- Removed `itemToHTML()` function (lines 806-831)
- Removed `findItem()` function (lines 833-845)  
- Removed commented `selectItem()` method documentation (lines 847-857)
- Removed the problematic macro loading lines (lines 898-901)
- Added proper file termination comment

### Verification
- Syntax check passed using Hammerspoon's built-in Lua interpreter
- Configuration loads successfully without errors
- All existing functionality preserved
- HammerGhost spoon continues to work correctly as it has its own copy of these functions

## Prevention Measures
- The HammerGhost spoon code should remain encapsulated within `Spoons/HammerGhost.spoon/`
- Main `init.lua` should only contain top-level configuration and module loading
- When merging, carefully review that spoon-specific code doesn't leak into main config

## Testing Results
- ✅ Configuration loads without errors
- ✅ Hotkeys remain functional
- ✅ HammerGhost spoon loads and operates correctly
- ✅ No regression in existing functionality

## Lessons Learned
1. **Merge Hygiene**: Always carefully review merge results, especially when multiple development branches modify similar areas
2. **Code Organization**: Maintain clear boundaries between main configuration and spoon-specific code
3. **Error Analysis**: Runtime errors involving `nil` global variables often indicate missing module imports or incorrectly placed code
4. **Testing**: Always perform syntax validation after resolving merge conflicts

## Impact Assessment
- **Severity**: High (prevented Hammerspoon from loading)
- **Scope**: Main configuration only
- **Risk**: Low ongoing risk with proper merge practices
- **Recovery**: Immediate and complete
