# Hotkey Binding Refactoring Summary

## Changes Made

### Problem
Several hotkey bindings in `hotkeys.lua` were inconsistent with the established pattern used throughout the file. They had:
- Inline function definitions instead of separate functions
- Inconsistent modifier key usage (`{ "ctrl", "alt", "cmd" }` instead of `hammer` or `_hyper`)
- Missing description strings

### Solution
Refactored three problematic hotkey bindings to follow the consistent pattern:

#### Before:
```lua
hs.hotkey.bind({ "ctrl", "alt", "cmd" }, "s", function()
    -- Long inline function...
end)
```

#### After:
```lua
hs.hotkey.bind(hammer, "s", "Save Current Layout", function() saveLayoutWithDialog() end)
```

### Specific Changes

1. **Line 259 - Save Layout Binding**
   - Extracted inline function to `saveLayoutWithDialog()`
   - Changed modifier from `{ "ctrl", "alt", "cmd" }` to `hammer`
   - Added description: "Save Current Layout"

2. **Layout Restore Binding**
   - Extracted inline function to `restoreLayoutChooser()`
   - Added description: "Restore Layout"
   - Maintained `hammer` modifier

3. **Layout Delete Binding**
   - Extracted inline function to `deleteLayoutChooser()`
   - Added description: "Delete Layout"
   - Maintained `_hyper` modifier

### Benefits
- **Consistency**: All hotkey bindings now follow the same pattern
- **Maintainability**: Functions are separated from bindings, easier to modify
- **Readability**: Clear descriptions and consistent formatting
- **Debugging**: Function names make it easier to trace calls in logs

### Functions Added
- `saveLayoutWithDialog()` - Prompts user for layout name and saves current window layout
- `restoreLayoutChooser()` - Shows chooser dialog to restore a saved layout
- `deleteLayoutChooser()` - Shows chooser dialog to delete a saved layout

### Pattern Established
The consistent pattern for hotkey bindings is:
```lua
hs.hotkey.bind(modifier, "key", "Description", function() ModuleName.functionName() end)
```

Where:
- `modifier` is either `hammer` or `_hyper`
- `"key"` is the key character
- `"Description"` describes what the hotkey does
- The function call is to a named function, not an inline definition
