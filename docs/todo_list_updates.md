# TODO List Reorganization Summary

## Overview
The TODO list for the Hammerspoon configuration has been reorganized to provide a more structured and actionable task list. This reorganization focuses on logical grouping, prioritization, and completeness.

## Changes Made

1. **Added Priority Tasks Section**
   - Created a new section at the top for high-priority tasks that need immediate attention
   - Selected critical tasks from other sections to highlight their importance

2. **Reorganized Categories**
   - Split the former "Redundancy and Overlap Issues" into more specific categories:
     - Window Management
     - Clipboard Management
   - Moved UI-related tasks into a dedicated "UI Improvements" section
   - Consolidated similar tasks from different sections

3. **Enhanced Existing Categories**
   - Added new, more specific tasks to each category
   - Ensured each category has at least 5-6 actionable items
   - Updated task descriptions to be more clear and specific

4. **Added New Tasks**
   - Added tasks for:
     - Style guide creation
     - Automated testing
     - User-specific configurations
     - Content filtering for clipboard
     - Multi-monitor support
     - User guide with examples
     - Voice command support
     - Mobile companion app

5. **Status Tracking**
   - Maintained existing status markers:
     - [X] for completed tasks
     - [O] for ongoing tasks
     - [ ] for pending tasks

## Benefits of Reorganization

1. **Better Focus**: The priority section helps focus attention on the most important tasks.
2. **Improved Organization**: Logical grouping makes it easier to work on related tasks together.
3. **More Comprehensive**: Additional tasks provide a more complete picture of what needs to be done.
4. **Future Planning**: New sections for future enhancements help with long-term planning.

## Next Steps

2. Consider adding estimated effort levels to tasks (e.g., easy, medium, hard)
3. Add target dates for priority items
4. Link tasks to specific GitHub issues for better tracking
