# HyperLogger Duplicate Messages Fix

## Problem Analysis

After examining the startup log file, I observed that each log message was appearing twice:

1. First as a styled message with file/line links
2. Then again with timestamps but no links

### Root Cause

The issue was in the HyperLogger.lua module. Each logging method (i, d, w, e) was:

1. Creating a log message with file/line information
2. Sending that message to the standard Hammerspoon logger (hs.logger)
3. **AND** also printing its own styled version directly to the console

This was causing every message to be output twice:
- Once by the base hs.logger (which includes timestamps)
- Once by the custom HyperLogger's styled text output

## Solution Implemented

1. Modified the HyperLogger methods to stop sending messages to the base logger
2. Kept the styled text output for better visual presentation and clickable file links
3. Reversed the order of message and file info in the styled text for better readability
4. Preserved the baseLogger for compatibility with other systems that might expect it

## Testing & Verification

The fix was committed to a new branch 'fix/duplicate-logs' with two commits:
1. The fix to HyperLogger.lua
2. Updates to the README.md file

To verify this works:
1. Reload Hammerspoon
2. Check that log messages only appear once
3. Verify that file links still work correctly when clicked

## Benefits

1. Cleaner console output with no duplicate messages
2. Preserved all functionality including clickable file links
3. Improved readability with logical message formatting

## Future Considerations

1. Could add an option to toggle whether messages should go to the standard logger
2. May want to enhance styling options for different log levels
3. Consider adding timestamp formatting options to the styled text output

## Learning

This issue highlights the importance of being careful when extending or wrapping existing functionality. The original implementation was trying to provide both standard logging and enhanced styled logging, but ended up duplicating messages.

A simpler design would be to either:
1. Completely replace the standard logger (what we've done)
2. Or provide a toggle to use one or the other, but not both simultaneously
