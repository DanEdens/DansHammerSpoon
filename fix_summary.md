# Hammerspoon Configuration Fixes

## Overview
Two critical bugs were fixed in the Hammerspoon configuration:

1. **OS Version String Error**: Fixed an error where the OS version table was being incorrectly concatenated as a string
2. **Missing Finder Function**: Added a missing function that was causing hotkey binding errors

## Fix 1: OS Version String Error
- **Issue**: The error `attempt to concatenate a table value` was occurring because `hs.host.operatingSystemVersion()` returns a table, not a string
- **Fix**: Modified the code to extract components from the table and create a properly formatted version string
- **Files Changed**: `init.lua`
- **Line Numbers**: Around line 875

## Fix 2: Missing Finder Function
- **Issue**: The error `At least one of pressedfn, releasedfn or repeatfn must be a function` was occurring because the `open_finder` function was missing
- **Fix**: Added the missing function to the AppManager module
- **Files Changed**: `AppManager.lua`
- **Documentation**: Created `docs/Hotkey-Fix.md` with details about the issue and fix

## Documentation Updates
- Added both fixes to the README.md "Recent Improvements" section
- Created detailed documentation in dedicated files

## Testing
Both fixes were tested by reloading the Hammerspoon configuration.

## Next Steps
Consider adding automated tests to catch similar issues in the future, particularly:
1. Verifying all referenced functions exist before binding hotkeys
2. Type checking for functions that expect specific return types
