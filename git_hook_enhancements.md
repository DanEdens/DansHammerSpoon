# Git Hook Enhancements for Hammerspoon Development

## Changes Implemented

Added automatic Hammerspoon reloading and console display to the pre-commit hook to improve the development workflow:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
git secrets --pre_commit_hook -- "$@"
hs -c 'hs.console.getConsole()'  # Opens the Hammerspoon console to show logs
hs -c 'hs.reload()'              # Reloads Hammerspoon to apply changes
```

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Feedback**: Changes to Hammerspoon configuration files take effect immediately after committing, without manual reloading
2. **Automatic Console Display**: The console window opens automatically to show log output
3. **Streamlined Development**: Eliminates the need to switch between coding and reloading
4. **Better Debugging**: Makes it easier to spot any issues introduced by changes

## Working with the Hook

This hook is triggered automatically when making a commit, ensuring that:
1. Your Hammerspoon configuration is reloaded with the latest changes
2. The console is displayed to show any startup logs or errors
3. You can immediately test your changes after committing

This complements the error handling improvements in the HyperLogger module, ensuring a more robust development experience.
