# Add robust error handling to HyperLogger

## Issue
HyperLogger was crashing when logging `nil` or unexpected data types:

```
2025-05-13 12:44:55: ERROR: LuaSkin: hs.hotkey callback: 
/Users/d.edens/.hammerspoon/HyperLogger.lua:37: ERROR: incorrect type 'nil' for argument 1 (expected table or number or string)
```

This occurred because:
1. The logger did not properly handle `nil` values or non-string data
2. hs.styledtext.new() requires specific types (table, number, or string)
3. The debug.getinfo() call could potentially fail in certain contexts
4. No error handling surrounded critical logging operations

## Solution
Added comprehensive error handling to make HyperLogger resilient against all input types:

1. **Safe Input Stringification**:
   - Handle nil values by converting to "[nil]" string
   - Convert tables to string using hs.inspect with fallback to tostring()
   - Special handling for function, userdata, and thread types
   - Safe conversion for all other data types

2. **Protected Function Calls**:
   - Wrapped all critical operations in pcall() for safe failure recovery
   - Added fallbacks for when styling functions fail
   - Ensured file and line information is always valid

3. **Layered Fallbacks**:
   - First tries full styled text with colors
   - Falls back to unstyled text if styling fails
   - Ultimate fallback to simple print() with log level prefix

## Benefits
- **Zero crashes**: Logger will no longer crash the application when passed unexpected data
- **Complete data display**: All data types can now be logged, with appropriate representation
- **Resilient operation**: Multiple layers of fallbacks ensure something useful always appears
- **Better debugging**: Improved handling of complex data structures through hs.inspect

## Testing
Manual testing with various input types shows the logger now handles:
- nil values
- Complex nested tables
- Functions
- Userdata objects
- All primitive types

## Additional Improvements
1. **Git Hook for Automatic Reloading**:
   - Added Hammerspoon reload command to pre-commit hook
   - Added console display command to show logs immediately after commit
   - Makes development smoother with immediate feedback on changes
   - Ensures the most recent code is always loaded in Hammerspoon

## Future Work
Consider adding:
- Configurable depth for table inspection
- Option to truncate extremely long strings
- Custom formatters for specific data types
