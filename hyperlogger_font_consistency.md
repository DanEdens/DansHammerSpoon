# HyperLogger Font Consistency Fixes

## Problem

The HyperLogger system was displaying inconsistent font styling and timestamps across different types of log messages:

1. **Font Inconsistency**: Log messages used different font sizes for different types of logs
2. **Unwanted Timestamps**: Some logs showed timestamps while others didn't
3. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Log initialization messages used plain print statements with a different style

These issues made the logs harder to read and created visual inconsistency in the Hammerspoon console.

## Solution

The following changes were implemented to ensure consistent, clean log formatting:

1. **Standardized Font Settings**:
   - Updated all log message font styling to use Menlo 18pt (matching init.lua settings)
   - Set file/line information to use Menlo 14pt for better readability
   - Ensured consistent font usage across all log types (info, debug, warning, error)

2. **Disabled Standard Logger Output**:
   - Set the underlying hs.logger instances to 'nothing' log level
   - This prevents the default Hammerspoon logger from displaying timestamps
   - All output is now handled by our custom styled formatting

3. **Styled Internal Messages**:
   - Created a `printStyledInit` function for consistent styling of initialization messages
   - Replaced all raw print() statements with styled equivalents
   - Added proper font size and styling to make these messages match other logs

4. **Created Testing Tool**:
   - Added a comprehensive test script (test_hyperlogger_font_consistency.lua)
   - Tests multiple loggers, different message types, and data formats
   - Verifies proper font consistency across all logs

## Benefits

- **Visual Consistency**: All log messages now have a consistent appearance
- **No Timestamps**: Clean log format without unnecessary timestamps
- **Improved Readability**: Standardized font sizes based on message importance
- **Better Debugging**: Consistent formatting makes logs easier to scan and understand

## Usage

No changes are required to existing code. All HyperLogger instances will automatically use the improved formatting.

To verify the consistent formatting:

```lua
hs.console.clear()
dofile("test_hyperlogger_font_consistency.lua")
```
