# DragonGrid Multi-Layer Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Completely Rewrote Grid Positioning System**
   - Redesigned how grid positions are calculated across multiple monitors
   - Added screen-relative coordinate calculations for all grid levels
   - Improved grid cell placement to properly account for monitor positions
   - Fixed the third level grid to properly appear inside the second level selection

2. **Enhanced Multi-level Grid Visualization**
   - Added coordinate information to the UI for debugging and transparency
   - Improved overlay drawing to only cover areas outside the selected cell
   - Added more visible highlighting for the selected sub-grid areas
   - Added level indicators showing current level out of total levels

3. **Improved Mouse Click Handling**
   - Added proper bounds checking for clicks outside grid areas
   - Fixed issues with click coordinate calculations on non-primary monitors
   - Added screen/window-relative coordinate transformations for clicks

4. **Better Navigation**
   - When going back a level with ⌘U, properly handles returning to level 1
   - Added debugging log messages to trace grid positioning
   - Made the update flow more logical and consistent

## Multi-monitor Support

The grid now properly handles multiple monitors by:
1. Using absolute screen coordinates throughout all grid levels
2. Calculating cell positions relative to their containing grid
3. Accounting for screen offsets when positioning overlays
4. Properly tracking selection history across levels

## Testing

When you activate DragonGrid (⌘X):
1. You'll see the level indicator (LEVEL 1 OF 3) and position information
2. Select a grid cell using ⌘1-9 or by clicking directly on it
3. The second level grid will appear inside the selected cell with proper highlighting
4. Select a cell in the second level grid
5. The third level grid will appear within that second level cell
6. Make your final selection to position the mouse

The grid should now work correctly across all monitors, with each level properly nested inside the previous selection.
