# Layouts Spoon Loading Issue Fix

## Issue Description

The Layouts spoon was not working correctly, causing this error when the hotkey was pressed:

```
stack traceback:
 /Users/d.edens/.hammerspoon/hotkeys.lua:66: in upvalue 'actualfn'
 ...merspoon.app/Contents/Resources/extensions/hs/hotkey.lua:231: in function <...merspoon.app/Contents/Resources/extensions/hs/hotkey.lua:231>
2025-06-11 10:48:46: 10:48:46 ERROR:   LuaSkin: hs.hotkey callback: /Users/d.edens/.hammerspoon/hotkeys.lua:66: attempt to call a nil value (field 'showLayoutsMenu')
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in `hotkeys.lua` line 66, where the code was trying to call `FileManager.showLayoutsMenu()`:

```lua
hs.hotkey.bind(hammer, "8", "Show Layouts Menu", function() FileManager.showLayoutsMenu() end)
```

However, this function does not exist in the FileManager module. The correct function is `chooseLayout()` and it should be called on the Layouts spoon.

## Fix Applied

Changed the hotkey binding from:

```lua
hs.hotkey.bind(hammer, "8", "Show Layouts Menu", function() FileManager.showLayoutsMenu() end)
```

To:

```lua
hs.hotkey.bind(hammer, "8", "Show Layouts Menu", function() spoon.Layouts:chooseLayout() end)
```

## Verification

1. The Layouts spoon is properly listed in `loadConfig.lua` and should be loaded
2. The Layouts spoon's `init.lua` provides the `chooseLayout()` function which shows a chooser dialog
3. Configuration validation passes with `./validate.sh`

## Available Layouts Spoon Functions

Based on the spoon's code, the available public functions are:

- `chooseLayout()` - Shows a chooser dialog to select and apply a layout
- `saveLayout()` - Saves the current window layout with a user-provided name
- `arrange(layoutName)` - Applies a specific layout by name
- `bindHotKeys(mapping)` - Binds hotkeys for the chooser

## Next Steps

1. Test the fix by pressing the hotkey (Hammer + 8)
2. If the Layouts spoon is not loaded, check the loadConfig.lua output in the Hammerspoon console
3. The spoon should show a chooser dialog when the hotkey is pressed
