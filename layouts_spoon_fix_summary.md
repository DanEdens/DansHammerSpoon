# Layouts Spoon Loading Issue Fix

## Issue Description

The Layouts spoon was not working correctly, causing this error when the hotkey was pressed:

```
stack traceback:
 /Users/d.edens/.hammerspoon/hotkeys.lua:66: in upvalue 'actualfn'
 ...merspoon.app/Contents/Resources/extensions/hs/hotkey.lua:231: in function <...merspoon.app/Contents/Resources/extensions/hs/hotkey.lua:231>
2025-06-11 10:48:46: 10:48:46 ERROR:   LuaSkin: hs.hotkey callback: /Users/d.edens/.hammerspoon/hotkeys.lua:66: attempt to call a nil value (field 'showLayoutsMenu')
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue had two parts:

1. **Missing Spoon Loading**: The `loadConfig.lua` module was never being loaded in `init.lua`, which meant that no Spoons were loaded and the `spoon` global table was nil. This caused the error "attempt to index a nil value (global 'spoon')".

2. **Incorrect Function Call**: Even if the Spoons were loaded, the hotkey was trying to call `FileManager.showLayoutsMenu()` instead of the correct `spoon.Layouts:chooseLayout()`.

The original error in `hotkeys.lua` line 66 was:

```lua
hs.hotkey.bind(hammer, "8", "Show Layouts Menu", function() FileManager.showLayoutsMenu() end)
```

However, this function does not exist in the FileManager module. The correct function is `chooseLayout()` and it should be called on the Layouts spoon.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Added Spoon Loading to init.lua

Added the loadConfig requirement to `init.lua`:

```lua
-- Load additional modules as needed
require('loadConfig')
dofile(hs.configdir .. "/hotkeys.lua")
```

### 2. Changed the hotkey binding

Changed from:

```lua
hs.hotkey.bind(hammer, "8", "Show Layouts Menu", function() FileManager.showLayoutsMenu() end)
```

To:

```lua
hs.hotkey.bind(hammer, "8", "Show Layouts Menu", function() spoon.Layouts:chooseLayout() end)
```

## Verification

1. ✅ Added `require('loadConfig')` to `init.lua` to ensure Spoons are loaded
2. ✅ The Layouts spoon is properly listed in `loadConfig.lua` and should now be loaded
3. ✅ The Layouts spoon's `init.lua` provides the `chooseLayout()` function which shows a chooser dialog
4. ✅ Fixed the hotkey to call the correct `spoon.Layouts:chooseLayout()` function
5. ✅ Configuration validation passes with `./validate.sh`

## Available Layouts Spoon Functions

Based on the spoon's code, the available public functions are:

- `chooseLayout()` - Shows a chooser dialog to select and apply a layout
- `saveLayout()` - Saves the current window layout with a user-provided name
- `arrange(layoutName)` - Applies a specific layout by name
- `bindHotKeys(mapping)` - Binds hotkeys for the chooser

## Next Steps

1. Test the fix by pressing the hotkey (Hammer + 8)
2. If the Layouts spoon is not loaded, check the loadConfig.lua output in the Hammerspoon console
3. The spoon should show a chooser dialog when the hotkey is pressed
