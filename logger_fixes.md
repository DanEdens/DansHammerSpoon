# HyperLogger Fixes

## Problem
The Hammerspoon configuration had an issue with multiple logger instances being created across different modules, leading to:
- Duplicate log entries
- Inconsistent logging behavior
- Potential memory usage issues
- Difficulty tracking the source of log messages

## Investigation
Created a diagnostic script (`diagnose_logger_instances.lua`) that identified:
1. Multiple logger instances with different namespaces
2. Both init.lua and hotkeys.lua creating their own loggers
3. Generic logger namespace names like "Logger" 
4. Inconsistent logger initialization patterns

## Changes Made
1. **Centralized logger initialization in init.lua**
   - Created a global application logger (_G.AppLogger)
   - Made it available to all modules

2. **Updated hotkeys.lua to use the global logger**
   - Removed its own logger initialization
   - Now relies on the global logger from init.lua

3. **Improved HyperLogger module**
   - Better default namespace ("HammerspoonLogger" instead of "Logger")
   - More descriptive internal logger name ("HyperLoggerInternal")
   - Strengthened singleton pattern implementation

4. **Created diagnostic tools**
   - New utility script to analyze logger instances
   - Helps identify potential logging issues
   - Provides recommendations for fixes

## Benefits
- **Reduced memory usage**: Fewer logger instances in memory
- **Consistent logging**: All modules use the same logger
- **Better namespace naming**: More descriptive logger names
- **Simplified code**: Modules don't need to create their own loggers

## Future Recommendations
1. Extend the centralized logger approach to all modules
2. Consider injecting the logger into modules rather than using globals
3. Standardize logger namespaces across the codebase
4. Add logging level control via Hammerspoon preferences
