# Dynamic Layout Capture Feature - Project Summary

## Project Goal
Create a programmable hotkey-based system to capture window layout positions through mouse clicks rather than requiring users to manually code layout coordinates.

## Features Implemented
- **Layout Capture System**: Capture window layout coordinates via mouse clicks
- **MongoDB Integration**: Store layouts in a persistent database
- **Custom API Server**: Python Flask server for CRUD operations on layouts
- **Hotkey Integration**: Easy-to-use keyboard shortcuts for layout management

## User Experience
1. User presses `hammer+a` to initiate layout capture
2. User enters a name for the layout
3. User clicks top-left and bottom-right corners of desired layout area
4. Layout is saved to MongoDB
5. User can later press `_hyper+a` to view and select from saved layouts

## Technical Implementation
- Created mouse event tracking system using `hs.eventtap`
- Built coordinate normalization for cross-screen compatibility
- Implemented function string serialization for layout storage
- Created REST API with Python Flask for database operations
- Added automatic API server management in Hammerspoon

## Pull Request
PR #2: [Add dynamic layout capture feature](https://github.com/DanEdens/DansHammerSpoon/pull/2)

## Lessons Learned
1. Hammerspoon's event capturing system provides powerful ways to interact with user input
2. MongoDB integration allows for more sophisticated data storage compared to simple JSON files
3. Creating a separate API server maintains clean separation of concerns
4. Converting absolute coordinates to relative values ensures layouts work across different screen sizes
5. Process management in Hammerspoon requires careful handling of process lifecycles

## Future Work
- Add visual feedback during layout capture
- Implement drag-to-select functionality for more intuitive capture
- Develop cloud synchronization for layouts between devices
- Create a visual layout editor for fine-tuning saved layouts
- Implement keyboard shortcut sequences for common layout patterns
