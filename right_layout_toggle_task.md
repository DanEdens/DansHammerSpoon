# Right Layout Toggle Implementation

## Task Completed

1. Modified the hammer+7 hotkey binding to toggle between rightSmall and rightHalf layouts:
   - Added a `rightLayoutState` table to track current state
   - Created `toggleRightLayout()` function to switch between layouts
   - Updated hammer+7 hotkey binding to use the toggle function
   - Updated README.md to document the new toggle feature

## Benefits

- Improves user experience by reducing the number of hotkeys needed for related actions
- Makes layout switching more intuitive by combining similar functions into a toggle
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing hyper+7 binding for direct rightHalf access
- Demonstrates pattern for implementing other toggles in the future

## Future Improvements

- Add visual feedback showing which layout is being applied during toggle
- Consider adding more toggle options for other common layout pairs
- Implement state persistence across Hammerspoon reloads
- Add ability to customize which layouts are included in the toggle cycle
