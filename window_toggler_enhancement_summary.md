# WindowToggler Enhancement Summary

## Overview

Enhanced the WindowToggler system to provide advanced window position management with multiple save locations, intelligent window identification, and improved multi-application support.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Multiple Save Locations

- **Location 1 & Location 2**: Each window can now save positions to two specific locations
- **Per-window basis**: Each window maintains its own set of saved locations
- **Independent of toggle functionality**: Locations work alongside the original toggle feature

### 2. Smart Window Identification  

- **Unique identifiers**: Windows identified by `AppName:WindowTitle` format
- **Multi-instance support**: Handles multiple windows from same app (e.g., different Cursor projects)
- **Better persistence**: More reliable window tracking across sessions

### 3. Automatic Window Selection

- **No focused window handling**: Shows window picker when no window is focused
- **Interactive chooser**: Lists all visible, standard windows with app and title
- **User-friendly format**: Clear display of "AppName - WindowTitle"

### 4. Enhanced Menu System

- **Locations menu**: Interactive menu for window location management  
- **Context-aware**: Shows different options based on window's saved state
- **Visual feedback**: Clear indication of existing vs new locations

## Hotkey Mappings

### New Hotkeys Added

| Hotkey | Function | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `Cmd+Ctrl+Alt+F10` | Save to Location 1 | Save current window position |
| `Cmd+Shift+Ctrl+Alt+F10` | Restore to Location 1 | Restore saved position |
| `Cmd+Ctrl+Alt+F11` | Save to Location 2 | Save current window position |
| `Cmd+Shift+Ctrl+Alt+F11` | Restore to Location 2 | Restore saved position |
| `Cmd+Ctrl+Alt+F12` | List Saved Windows | Show all saved positions |
| `Cmd+Shift+Ctrl+Alt+Q` | Clear All Locations | Clear Location 1 & 2 saves |

### Modified Hotkeys

| Hotkey | Old Function | New Function |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| `Cmd+Shift+Ctrl+Alt+W` | List Saved Windows | Window Locations Menu |

## Technical Improvements

### Code Architecture

- **Consistent singleton pattern**: Prevents multiple module initializations
- **Helper functions**: Clean separation of concerns with getWindowIdentifier and getTargetWindow
- **Better error handling**: Graceful handling of missing windows and apps

### Data Structure

```lua
WindowToggler = {
    savedPositions = {},  -- Original toggle positions (AppName:WindowTitle -> frame)
    location1 = {},       -- Location 1 saves (AppName:WindowTitle -> frame)  
    location2 = {}        -- Location 2 saves (AppName:WindowTitle -> frame)
}
```

### Window Identification

- **Before**: Stored by window title only (collision-prone)
- **After**: Stored by `AppName:WindowTitle` (unique identification)
- **Benefits**: Handles multiple Cursor windows, Terminal sessions, browser windows

## Use Cases Addressed

### 1. Multiple Cursor Projects

- Different Cursor windows for different projects
- Each maintains separate saved positions
- No interference between project windows  

### 2. Development Workflow

- **Location 1**: Primary coding position
- **Location 2**: Secondary reference position
- **Toggle**: Quick full-screen switch
- **Menu**: Interactive management

### 3. Multi-App Development

- Terminal sessions with specific positions
- Browser windows for testing
- IDE windows for different projects
- Each maintains independent location memory

## User Experience Improvements

### 1. Discoverability

- Clear hotkey descriptions in bindings
- Interactive menu system
- Visual feedback with app names in alerts

### 2. Reliability  

- Automatic window selection when needed
- Better window tracking across app restarts
- Consistent behavior regardless of focus state

### 3. Flexibility

- Multiple save slots per window
- Mix of quick toggle and precise positioning
- Context-aware menu options

## Testing & Validation

### Syntax Validation

- All files pass Hammerspoon validation
- No syntax errors introduced
- Proper module loading confirmed

### Hotkey Mapping Review

- No conflicts with existing hotkeys
- Logical grouping of related functions
- Intuitive modifier combinations

## Future Enhancements Possible

### Potential Additions

- **Persistent storage**: Save locations across Hammerspoon restarts
- **More locations**: Extend to Location 3, 4, etc.
- **Layout templates**: Save entire screen layouts
- **Hotkey customization**: User-configurable hotkey mappings

### Integration Opportunities

- **Project Manager**: Link window locations to projects  
- **HammerGhost**: Add window location actions
- **Layouts system**: Integrate with existing layout management

## Files Modified

1. **WindowToggler.lua**: Complete rewrite with enhanced functionality
2. **hotkeys.lua**: Added new hotkey bindings and updated existing ones
3. **README.md**: Added comprehensive documentation section
4. **window_toggler_enhancement_summary.md**: This summary document

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Window Identification

- Window titles alone are insufficient for multi-instance apps
- App name + title provides reliable unique identification
- Important to handle missing/invalid window references gracefully

### 2. User Interface Design

- Automatic window selection improves usability significantly
- Interactive menus provide better discoverability than memorized hotkeys
- Visual feedback with app names enhances user confidence

### 3. Hotkey Management

- Function key combinations (F10, F11) provide good expansion space
- Consistent modifier patterns (hammer vs hyper) aid memorization
- Documentation in hotkey descriptions improves maintainability

### 4. Code Organization

- Helper functions improve code readability and reusability
- Callback-based patterns handle async operations elegantly
- Singleton pattern prevents module initialization issues

## Conclusion

The WindowToggler enhancement significantly improves window management capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility. The new features address real workflow needs for developers working with multiple applications and projects simultaneously. The implementation follows established patterns in the codebase and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.
