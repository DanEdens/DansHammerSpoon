# WindowToggler Persistence Enhancement

## Summary

Enhanced the WindowToggler module to persist window locations (Location 1 and Location 2) across Hammerspoon configuration reloads by implementing JSON-based file storage.

## Problem Solved

Previously, when a user saved window positions to Location 1 or Location 2 using WindowToggler, these positions would be lost when Hammerspoon reloaded its configuration. This created a poor user experience as users would have to re-save their preferred window positions after every config reload.

## Solution Implemented

### File-Based Persistence

- Added persistent storage using JSON format
- Storage location: `~/.hammerspoon/data/window_locations.json`
- Data structure includes:

  ```json
  {
    "location1": {
      "AppName:WindowTitle": {"x": 100, "y": 100, "w": 800, "h": 600}
    },
    "location2": {
      "AppName:WindowTitle": {"x": 200, "y": 200, "w": 800, "h": 600}
    },
    "savedAt": 1623456789
  }
  ```

### Key Functions Added

1. **`ensureDataDirectory()`**: Creates the data directory if it doesn't exist
2. **`saveLocations()`**: Saves current locations to JSON file with error handling
3. **`loadLocations()`**: Loads saved locations from JSON file on module initialization

### Integration Points

- **Module Initialization**: Automatically loads saved locations when module starts
- **Save Operations**: Automatically persists data when locations are saved
- **Clear Operations**: Automatically persists changes when locations are cleared

## Technical Implementation Details

### Error Handling

- Uses `pcall()` for safe JSON operations and file I/O
- Gracefully handles missing files, corrupted JSON, or write permission issues
- Logs success/failure of persistence operations

### Performance Considerations

- Minimal overhead: only saves when locations change
- File I/O operations are wrapped in error handling to prevent crashes
- Uses existing HyperLogger for consistent debugging information

### Data Safety

- Creates backup timestamp with each save operation
- Validates JSON structure before loading
- Falls back to empty tables if data is corrupted

## Testing Results

Created and ran comprehensive test suite (`test_window_toggler_persistence.lua`) that verified:

- ✓ WindowToggler module loads successfully
- ✓ Data directory creation works
- ✓ JSON encoding/decoding functions correctly
- ✓ File write/read operations work properly
- ✓ All persistence tests passed

## Files Modified

1. **`WindowToggler.lua`**:
   - Added persistence functions
   - Integrated save/load calls with existing functions
   - Enhanced error handling and logging

2. **`README.md`**:
   - Updated Technical Implementation section
   - Documented the persistence feature
   - Noted automatic persistence behavior

## User Impact

### Before

- Window locations lost on every Hammerspoon reload
- Users had to manually re-save preferred positions
- Frustrating workflow interruption

### After

- Window locations automatically persist across reloads
- Seamless user experience
- No additional user action required
- Maintains all existing functionality

## Lessons Learned

1. **JSON Persistence Pattern**: Successfully established a reusable pattern for persisting data in Hammerspoon modules using JSON files in the `~/.hammerspoon/data/` directory.

2. **Error Handling Importance**: Robust error handling is crucial for file operations to prevent module crashes that would break hotkey functionality.

3. **Module Initialization Order**: Persistence loading should happen during module initialization to ensure data is available immediately.

4. **Testing Strategy**: Creating focused test scripts helps validate complex functionality like file I/O and JSON operations within the Hammerspoon environment.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be made:

- Implement data migration/versioning for future schema changes
- Add option to export/import location configurations
- Implement automatic cleanup of stale window entries
- Add configuration option to disable persistence if desired
