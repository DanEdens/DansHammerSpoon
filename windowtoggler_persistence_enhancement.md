# WindowToggler Persistence Enhancement

## Summary

Enhanced the WindowToggler module to persist window locations (Location 1 and Location 2) across Hammerspoon configuration reloads by implementing JSON-based file storage.

## Problem Solved

Previously, when a user saved window positions to Location 1 or Location 2 using WindowToggler, these positions would be lost when Hammerspoon reloaded its configuration. This created a poor user experience as users would have to re-save their preferred window positions after every config reload.

## Solution Implemented

### File-Based Persistence

- Added persistent storage using JSON format
- Storage location: `~/.hammerspoon/data/window_locations.json`
- Data structure includes:

  ```json
  {
    "location1": {
      "AppName:WindowTitle": {"x": 100, "y": 100, "w": 800, "h": 600}
    },
    "location2": {
      "AppName:WindowTitle": {"x": 200, "y": 200, "w": 800, "h": 600}
    },
    "savedAt": 1623456789
  }
  ```

### Key Functions Added

1. **`ensureDataDirectory()`**: Creates the data directory if it doesn't exist
2. **`saveLocations()`**: Saves current locations to JSON file with error handling
3. **`loadLocations()`**: Loads saved locations from JSON file on module initialization

### Integration Points

- **Module Initialization**: Automatically loads saved locations when module starts
- **Save Operations**: Automatically persists data when locations are saved
- **Clear Operations**: Automatically persists changes when locations are cleared

## Technical Implementation Details

### Error Handling

- Uses `pcall()` for safe JSON operations and file I/O
- Gracefully handles missing files, corrupted JSON, or write permission issues
- Logs success/failure of persistence operations

### Performance Considerations

- Minimal overhead: only saves when locations change
- File I/O operations are wrapped in error handling to prevent crashes
- Uses existing HyperLogger for consistent debugging information

### Data Safety

- Creates backup timestamp with each save operation
- Validates JSON structure before loading
- Falls back to empty tables if data is corrupted

## Testing Results

Created and ran comprehensive test suite (`test_window_toggler_persistence.lua`) that verified:

- ✓ WindowToggler module loads successfully
- ✓ Data directory creation works
- ✓ JSON encoding/decoding functions correctly
- ✓ File write/read operations work properly
- ✓ All persistence tests passed

## Files Modified

1. **`WindowToggler.lua`**:
   - Added persistence functions
   - Integrated save/load calls with existing functions
   - Enhanced error handling and logging

2. **`README.md`**:
   - Updated Technical Implementation section
   - Documented the persistence feature
   - Noted automatic persistence behavior

## User Impact

### Before

- Window locations lost on every Hammerspoon reload
- Users had to manually re-save preferred positions
- Frustrating workflow interruption

### After

- Window locations automatically persist across reloads
- Seamless user experience
- No additional user action required
- Maintains all existing functionality

## Lessons Learned

1. **JSON Persistence Pattern**: Successfully established a reusable pattern for persisting data in Hammerspoon modules using JSON files in the `~/.hammerspoon/data/` directory.

2. **Error Handling Importance**: Robust error handling is crucial for file operations to prevent module crashes that would break hotkey functionality.

3. **Module Initialization Order**: Persistence loading should happen during module initialization to ensure data is available immediately.

4. **Testing Strategy**: Creating focused test scripts helps validate complex functionality like file I/O and JSON operations within the Hammerspoon environment.

5. **Geometry Object Serialization**: Hammerspoon's `hs.geometry` objects cannot be directly serialized to JSON because they contain methods and metadata. They must be converted to plain tables with only the numerical properties (`x`, `y`, `w`, `h`) before JSON encoding, then converted back to geometry objects after loading.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be made:

- Implement data migration/versioning for future schema changes
- Add option to export/import location configurations
- Implement automatic cleanup of stale window entries
- Add configuration option to disable persistence if desired

## Commit Information

- **Initial Commit Hash**: f2c5f8a
- **JSON Fix Commit Hash**: 7dca122
- **Files Changed**: 2 (WindowToggler.lua, README.md) + 1 fix (WindowToggler.lua)
- **Lines Added**: 78 insertions + 40 additional for JSON fix
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite created and validated

## Post-Implementation Fix

### JSON Serialization Issue

After initial implementation, discovered that `hs.geometry` objects returned by `win:frame()` cannot be directly serialized to JSON due to containing methods and non-serializable data.

**Error encountered:**

```
LuaSkin: Object cannot be serialised as JSON
```

**Solution implemented:**

1. **`geometryToTable(geom)`**: Converts geometry objects to plain Lua tables
2. **`tableToGeometry(tbl)`**: Converts plain tables back to geometry objects
3. **`prepareLocationsForSaving(locations)`**: Converts all geometry objects before JSON encoding
4. **`prepareLocationsAfterLoading(locations)`**: Converts all tables back to geometry objects after JSON decoding

**Key insight:** Hammerspoon's geometry objects must be converted to plain tables containing only `x`, `y`, `w`, `h` values for JSON serialization.
