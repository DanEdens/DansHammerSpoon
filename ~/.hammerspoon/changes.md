# Fixed loadConfig Module Loading and Table Concatenation

## Problem
The Hammerspoon initialization was failing with an error:
```
attempt to concatenate a table value (field 'loaded')
```

This occurred because:
1. The code in init.lua was trying to directly concatenate a table returned by loadConfig.lua with a string
2. loadConfig.lua was being loaded with dofile() instead of being structured as a proper module

## Changes Made
1. Modified init.lua to:
   - Use loadModuleGlobally() instead of dofile() to load loadConfig.lua
   - Fixed string concatenation by using table.concat() to properly convert the tables to strings

2. Restructured loadConfig.lua to:
   - Follow the proper Lua module pattern with a local module table
   - Populate the module table with results
   - Return the module table for use with require()

## Benefits
- Properly structured code following Lua module conventions
- Fixed the runtime error preventing Hammerspoon from initializing
- Improved log readability with better formatting

These changes preserve the existing functionality while making the code more robust and maintainable.
